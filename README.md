# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
# challenge-05

Challenge-05 was a focus on third-party APIs and required the creation of a work day scheduler.  Upon loading, the page will show current date and times will be identified by past/present/future colors set in style sheet.  Entered data is stored in local storage once the save button is clicked and is recalled on page load.

## Key Learnings

In this project, I was able to get a better understanding of how to store and retrieve data to local storage.  I was given an opportunity to utilize "split" and "parseInt" to grab specific data which will be very useful knowledge moving forward

## Challenges

Some of the more challenging aspects of this project were the add/remove class methods as well as the parent/sibling methods within jquery.  I struggled to understand why add and remove rules were needed for each if/else statement, but I was unable to get the desired results without doing so.  

Once the save button is clicked there is a method called to the parent to assign the id for use as the key in local storage, and a method called to the sibling with a class of description to use as the value in local storage.  This took me a while to grasp, but was pretty straight forward once I got a handle on it
